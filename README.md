# File-specific information

data_figure2: MTT assay results (signal minus background, 540nm reading - 630 nm reading) for four plates: three replicates of the PE gel results and one of the Am-only gel results. Results were normalized for visualization using the control wells on the respective plates.

data_figure3: Acrylamide concentrations (g/mL) from 70/3-70/24 gel washes over 4 days. "L" indicates low-PI gels and "H" indicates high-PI gels. Each column represents one gel. Three samples of each gel were included in this experiment. Concentrations were calculated from the acrylamide calibration curve shown in Supplementary Figure 1 using linear extrapolation.

data_figure4: MTT assay results (signal minus background, 540nm reading - 630 nm reading) for two plates: one for gels 70/3-70/12, one for gels 70/18 and 70/24. Each gel had three separate samples per plate. Results were normalized for visualization using the control wells on the respective plates. 

data_figure5: Rheology results for initial-swelled, sandwich-swelled, and fully-swelled 70/3-70/24 gels (averaged over 3 samples). G' and G" values (Pa) presented for corresponding strain values (%). 

data_figure6: Rheology results for sandwich-swelled low-PI and high-PI 70/3-70/24 gels (averaged over 3 samples). G' and G" values (Pa) presented for corresponding strain values (%). 

data_figure7: The original data for this figure comes from the figure 5 and figure 6 datasets, but the plotted values are reproduced here as mean ± SD for convenience.

data_figure8: Rheology results for cyclic deformation tests on one gel per composition (70/3-70/24). Time (sec), strain (%), G*, G', G" (Pa), and loss tangent (G"/G') are included for each experiment. Non-physical outliers, defined as rows with strain < 0.15%, were removed from the data.

data_figure9: The original data for this figure comes from the figure 8 dataset, but the plotted values are reproduced here as [mean, SD, N] for convenience.

data_figure10: Micromotion data is presented as [mean, SD, N] versus distance from probe center for all gels 70/3-70/24 and the control PEGDA gel.
