# File-specific information

data_figure2: MTT assay results (signal minus background, 540nm reading - 630 nm reading) for four plates: three replicates of the PE gel results and one of the Am-only gel results. Results were normalized for visualization using the control wells on the respective plates.

data_figure4: MTT assay results (signal minus background, 540nm reading - 630 nm reading) for two plates: one for gels 70/3-70/12, one for gels 70/18 and 70/24. Each gel had three separate samples per plate. Results were normalized for visualization using the control wells on the respective plates. </br>
